# scripts-holdmydonut
This repository adds scripts to Streamlabs Chatbot to allow users to use a more flexible method of rewarding the first chatters once the stream has started

# Requirements
This library is standalone and only requires python scripting to be enabled in your Steamlabs Chatbot.

# Installation
To install this library navigate to your streamlabs chatbot scripts folder. Once there clone the respository.

# Usage
This library can be used primarily through the twitch chat interface. Once the repository has been cloned go to your `<script>` tab in your chatbot. Once there click on the backend script and ensure that it is activated. Then adjust the settings as you see fit and save the settings. After saving the settings reload the scripts and you should be ready to go.

The following commands can then be used:

## First
```
!first / !second / !third
```
If the user is the first to use the command then they will be rewarded a certain amount of points. Additionally, the second and  third users will also get a payout but with dimished rewards.
